# khet-AI
Khet AI created in collaboration with Jeffrey Barratt for Menlo School's Advanced Topics in Computer Science class in Winter 2013.  This AI was built to play an AI-friendly java-based version of Khet 2.0, a popular laser-based board game.  DaWeeklyAI successfully defeated all opponents in both Advanced Topics in Computer Science classes, to become the 2013 Khet AI champion.

John McNelly was responsible for heuristics algorithms used to rate the game state, while Jeffrey Barratt built the structure that generated potential gamestates to be chosen from for the AI's next move against its component.
